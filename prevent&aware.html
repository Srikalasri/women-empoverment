    <h1>INTRODUCTION :</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Women‘s empowerment in India is heavily dependent on many different variables that include
        geographical location (urban/rural), educational status, social status (caste and class), and age.
        Policies on women‘s empowerment exist at the national, state, and local (Panchayat) levels in many
        sectors, including health, education, economic opportunities, gender-based violence, and politicalparticipation. 
        However, there are significant gaps between policy advancements and actual practiceat the community level.
        One key factor for the gap in implementation of laws and policies to address discrimination,economic disadvantages, and violence against women at the community level is the largelypatriarchal structure that governs the community and households in much of India. 
        As such, womenand girls have restricted mobility, access to education, access to health facilities, and lower decision-making power, and experience higher rates of violence. 
        Political participation is also hindered at thePanchayat (local governing bodies) level and at the state and national levels, despite existingreservations for women.

    <h1>RAISING AWARENESS</h1>
    <p class="para">

        It involves ensuring equal access to education, employement opertunities, and financial resources.
        Lady empowerment in the economic sphere means closing the gender pay gap, promrting entreneurship among women.

    <h1>Victim Blaming :</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Victim-blaming attitudes marginalize the victim/survivor and make it harder to come forward and report the abuse.
        If the survivor knows that you or society blames her for the abuse, she will not feel safe or comfortable coming forward and talking to you.
        <br><br>
        Victim-blaming attitudes also reinforce what the abuser has been saying all along that is the victim's fault this is happening.
        It is NOT the victim's fault or responsibility to fix the solution it is the abuser's choice.
        By engaging in victim blaming attitudes, society allows the abuser to perpetrate relationship abuse or sexual assault while avoiding accountability for his/her avtions.

    <h1>My Activity</h1>
    <p class="para1">
        I  have taken permission in schools in near  by areas to give awareness to students about crime against women.we make a PPT to rising awareness to the students.
        concerted action is needed to end violence against women and girls.
        Whether you're talking to your friends and family, or engaging with an advocacy organization, the most important way to be an advocate is speaking up. 
        By raising your voice for women's rights and gender equality, you can spread awareness and break down barriers.
