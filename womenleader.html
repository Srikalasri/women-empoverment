      <h1>Conclusion :</h1>
      <p class="para">
        woman represent half of the world's population and gender
        inequality exists in every nation on the planet.
        until women are given the same opportunities that men are, entire societies
        will be destined to perform below their true 
        potentials. The greatest need of the hour is change of social attitude to women.
        The dream of women empovered to play equal 
        decisive and appropriate role in the family, which is the basic 
        unit of empowerment.
