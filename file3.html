    <h1>Introduction :</h1>
    <p class="para1">Societyâ€™s Approach Towards Crime Against Women
        Rape, molestation, kidnapping and murder are the most common forms of crime against women in India.
        The women in India are also vulnerable to acid attacks and eve-teasing. The mindset of the people, including the victim and the spectator, is to ignore and just let it go.<br>
        But, what we, as the responsible citizens of an independent country, fail to realise is that these instances of harassment can flare up into other bigger heinous crimes against women.<br>
        And that is when the importance of learning self-defence techniques for women is felt.

    <h1>Domestic voilence :</h1>
    <p class="para1">Domestic violence is violence or other abuse that occurs in a domestic setting, such as in a marriage or cohabitation. Domestic violence is often used as a synonym for intimate partner violence, which is committed by one of the people in an intimate relationship against the other person, and can take place in relationships or between former spouses or partners. In its broadest sense, domestic violence also involves violence against children, parents, or the elderly. It can assume multiple forms, including physical, verbal, emotional, economic, religious, reproductive, financial abuse, or sexual abuse. It can range from subtle, coercive forms to marital rape and other violent physical abuse, such as choking, beating, female genital mutilation, and acid throwing that may result in disfigurement or death, and includes the use of technology to harass, control, monitor, stalk or hack.[1][2] Domestic murder includes stoning, bride burning, honor killing, and dowry death, which sometimes involves non-cohabitating family members. In 2015, the United Kingdom's Home Office widened the definition of domestic violence to include coercive control</p>
