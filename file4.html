    <h1>INTRODUCTION :</h1>
    <p class="para">Women‘s empowerment in India is heavily dependent on many different variables that include
        geographical location (urban/rural), educational status, social status (caste and class), and age.
        Policies on women‘s empowerment exist at the national, state, and local (Panchayat) levels in many
        sectors, including health, education, economic opportunities, gender-based violence, and politicalparticipation.
         However, there are significant gaps between policy advancements and actual practiceat the community level.
         One key factor for the gap in implementation of laws and policies to address discrimination,economic disadvantages, and violence against women at the community level is the largelypatriarchal structure that governs the community and households in much of India. 
         As such, womenand girls have restricted mobility, access to education, access to health facilities, and lower decision-making power, and experience higher rates of violence. 
         Political participation is also hindered at thePanchayat (local governing bodies) level and at the state and national levels, despite existingreservations for women.

        And the major treatment and prevention interventions, such as child maltreatment systems, casework, protective orders, and health care the victims of domestic violence, battered women’s shelters, elder abuse interventions, of all the types, have not been the subjects of rigorous evaluation studies.
